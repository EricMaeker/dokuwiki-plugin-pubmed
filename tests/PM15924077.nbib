AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls and dementia are two major public health problems which concern 
      the elderly population. Cognitive impairment, as a result of Alzheimer's disease or 
      non-Alzheimer dementia, is recognized as a risk factor for falling. Through the 
      experience of the Multidisciplinary Falls Consultation, our aims were first, to 
      evaluate the prevalence of a cognitive decline among outpatients who consult for 
      falls, and second, to determine whether the cognitive impairment was known and 
      diagnosed before the consultation or not. METHODS: Data concerning the first 300 
      outpatients who completed the initial evaluation are reported. Each patient was 
      assessed by a geriatrician, a neurologist, and a physiatrist, who visited him or her 
      at home. Cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
      score<24. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients, 228 patients completed the initial 
      evaluation. Among them, 97 (42.5 percent) had a MMSE score<24; 55 had mild stage 
      dementia (MMSE score between 23 and 18) and 42 were at a moderate or severe stage 
      (MMSE score< or =17/30). The cognitive decline was not diagnosed before the 
      consultation in 80 of the 97 patients (82 percent). CONCLUSION: The findings show 
      that a large proportion of old persons presenting with gait disturbance at the 
      Multidisciplinary Falls Consultation have an underlying cognitive decline. 
      Assessment of cognitive functions is required in every elderly faller.
